A selection of the most useful templates, scripts, automations, and Lovelace configs I have in my HA config.

Automations include:
* Actionable notification when garage is opened
* Automatically open the shades when you're awake, when the sun is up, and when it is not too hot outside
* Automatically open the shades when your alarm goes off
* Turn off the lights after a frontend selected delay
