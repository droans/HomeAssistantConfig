# Inputs to adjust the actions for the multipress sensors
# All files in this directory are designed to be used together. I will not diagnose issues you may run into otherwise.
# 
# Allows for the switch actions to be changed in the frontend by the user.
# My Ikea switches are not setup for multipress actions. This can be changed by the user, though.
#
# Substitutes:
#   * FRIENDLY NAME: The name given to the inputs
#   * ENTITY_ID_enable: Input to enable the switch
#   * ENTITY_ID_XXXX_action: The action to be performed with the switch selected
#   * ENTITY_ID_XXXX_entity: The entity to perform the action on
#   * ENTITY_ID_XXXX_color: If any Set Color actions are selected, this will allow the user to select the color
#   * ENTITY_ID_XXXX_brightness: If any Set Brightness actions are selected, this will allow the user to select the brightness
#   * ENTITY_ID_XXXX_white_balance: If any Set Temperature actions are selected, this will allow the user to select the white balance
#   * ENTITY_ID_XXXX_1x-5x_XXXX: Same as the above but only for that action
#   * /path/to/multipress_action_options.yaml: The path to the file including the action options. Save this outside of your packages directory
